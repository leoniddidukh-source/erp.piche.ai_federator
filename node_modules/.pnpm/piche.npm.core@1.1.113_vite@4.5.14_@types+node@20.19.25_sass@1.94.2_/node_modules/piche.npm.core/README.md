# 📦 NPM Package for Innovative Solutions

Introducing our npm package, designed to power amazing and innovative solutions. Our package provides the basic functionality required to implement groundbreaking solutions in various industries. With easy installation and comprehensive documentation, developers can quickly integrate our package into their projects and leverage its capabilities.

# How to Test This Package in Another Project

This guide explains how to test **`piche.npm.core`** inside a different Vite-based project during development.

---

### 1. Build Package

**`pnpm build`**
Make sure the dist folder exists — this is what your consuming project will import.

✅ If you make changes to the package, rebuild it before re-testing in the consuming app.

### 2. Navigate to Your Target Project

In the target project, open the **`vite.config.ts`** file and prepare to add alias settings.

```ts
resolve: {
  alias: {
    // add your aliases here
  }
}
```

### 3. Add Alias Configuration

Inside the **`resolve.alias`** section of the config, add the necessary aliases to resolve the local package correctly.
Replace **`your-local-path`** with your own absolute or relative path

```ts
'react': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react'),
'react-dom': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react-dom'),
'piche.npm.core': path.resolve(__dirname, 'your-local-path/piche.npm.core/dist'),
```
